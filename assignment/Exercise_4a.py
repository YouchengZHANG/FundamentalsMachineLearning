# What do the feature names (e.g. column games) stand for?
# games: the number of games in the player-referee dyad
# playerâ€“referee dyads including the number of matches players and referees encountered each other 
# the number of red cards given to a player by a particular referee throughout all matches the two encountered each other.

# Which irrelevant features might be dropped?
# birthday, ties, defeats, goals,yellowCards, nIAT, seIAT, nExp, seExp, victories, Alpha_3, photoID(unless want to improve color rating)

# How good are the skin color ratings? Do the raters agree?

# No.

# Yes.
